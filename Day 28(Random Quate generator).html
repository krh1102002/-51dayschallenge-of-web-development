      let quote=["When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go","Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible!'","There is nothing impossible to they who will try.","The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot.","Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.","You define your own life. Don't let other people write your script.","You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.","Spread love everywhere you go.","Belief creates the actual fact.","It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.","Believe you can and you're halfway there.","Weaknesses are just strengths in the wrong environment.","In a gentle way, you can shake the world.","Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.","Wake up determined, go to bed satisfied.","Nobody built like you, you design yourself.","Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.","Faith is love taking the form of aspiration.","When it comes to luck, you make your own.","We generate fears while we sit. We overcome them by action.","Work hard, know your s—t, show your s—t, and then feel entitled.","Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.","You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.","How wild it was, to let it be.","You do not find the happy life. You make it.","Definitions belong to the definers, not the defined.","You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.","We have to let go of who we think we should be and embrace what is.","Being vulnerable is a strength, not a weakness.","I don't look ahead. I'm right here with you. It's a good way to be.","In order for the light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present.","The power of imagination makes us infinite.","The only journey is the one within.","Embrace the glorious mess that you are."];
